## San Francisco Rental Analysis with Visualization

The attached two notebooks contain a rental analysis for the San Francisco area from 2010 - 2016 and a corresponding dashboard panel for visual reference.
The dashboard contains the following charts:
1. **Housing Units** tracks the number of housing units in San Francisco.
2. **Average Gross Rents** charts the average gross rents.
3. **Average Sales Price** charts the average sales price per square foot.
4. **Average Price Per Neighborhood** narrows the average sales price per square foot to focus on individual neighborhoods. This is an interactive chart allowing you to select individual neighborhoods one at a time.
5. **Top Most Expensive Neighborhoods** displays the top ten most expensive neighborhoods ranked by average sales price per square foot.
6. **Parallel Coordinates** allows further trend analysis by sales price per square foot and gross rents.
7. **Parallel Categories** provides more analysis detail including neighborhood data.
8. **Neighborhood Map** provides a unique analytical selection process by visualizing the San Francisco neighborhoods on a map.

Within the dashboard notebook, the plots will render by executing the cells. They will be organized by _tabular selection_ as well as through an _All Plots_ tabular option to view every chart in one column.
